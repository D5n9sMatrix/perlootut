A vector space can also be made up of other objects, such as matrices.
The key characteristic of a vector space is a linear algebra.
We generally use a calligraphic font to denote a vector space; V, for exam-
ple. Often, however, we think of the vector space merely in terms of the set
of vectors on which it is built and denote it by an ordinary capital letter; V ,
for example.
