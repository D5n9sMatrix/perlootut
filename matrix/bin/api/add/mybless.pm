rotation matrices, and matrices arising from graph-theoretic approaches to
data analysis. These matrices have applications in clustering, data mining,
stochastic processes, and graphics; therefore, I describe these matrices and
their special properties. I also discuss the geometry of matrix algebra. This
provides a better intuition of the operations. Homogeneous coordinates and
special operations in IR 3 are covered because of their geometrical applications
in statistical graphics.

=head1 Name

Part II addresses selected applications in data analysis. Applications are
referred to frequently in Part I, and of course, the choice of topics for coverage
was motivated by applications. The diﬀerence in Part II is in its orientation.

=head2 Synopsis

Only “selected” applications in data analysis are addressed; there are ap-
plications of matrix algebra in almost all areas of statistics, including the
theory of estimation, which is touched upon in Chapter 4 of Part I. Certain
types of matrices are more common in statistics, and Chapter 8 discusses in
more detail some of the important types of matrices that arise in data analy-
sis and statistical modeling. Chapter 9 addresses selected applications in data
analysis. The material of Chapter 9 has no obvious deﬁnition that could be
covered in a single chapter (or a single part, or even a single book), so I have
chosen to discuss brieﬂy a wide range of areas. Most of the sections and even
subsections of Chapter 9 are on topics to which entire books are devoted;
however, I do not believe that any single book addresses all of them.

=head3 Documentation

Part III covers some of the important details of numerical computations,
with an emphasis on those for linear algebra. I believe these topics constitute
the most important material for an introductory course in numerical analysis
for statisticians and should be covered in every such course.

=head4 Usage

Except for speciﬁc computational techniques for optimization, random
number generation, and perhaps symbolic computation, Part III provides the
basic material for a course in statistical computing. All statisticians should
have a passing familiarity with the principles.
