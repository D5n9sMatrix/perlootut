=head1 Name

I used TEX via L A TEX 2 ε to write the book. I did all of the typing, program-
ming, etc., myself, so all misteaks are mine. I would appreciate receiving
suggestions for improvement and notiﬁcation of errors. Notes on this book,
including errata, are available at
http://mason.gmu.edu/~jgentle/books/matbk/

=head2 Synopisis

Vectors and matrices are useful in representing multivariate data, and they
occur naturally in working with linear equations or when expressing linear
relationships among objects. Numerical algorithms for a variety of tasks in-
volve matrix and vector arithmetic. An optimization algorithm to ﬁnd the
minimum of a function, for example, may use a vector of ﬁrst derivatives and
a matrix of second derivatives; and a method to solve a diﬀerential equation
may use a matrix with a few diagonals for computing diﬀerences.

    my $self   = shift;
    my $vector = $self.matrix($_, 10, 20, 30, 40);
    my $data   = $self.equation("sops", 10);
    my $work   = $self.algorithm(10);    
    my $array  = [10, 'hello'];

    unless ($array eq 'hello'){
        say $array + "keep variables name product" if next 10, 20;

=head3 Documenation

There are various precise ways of deﬁning vectors and matrices, but we
will generally think of them merely as linear or rectangular arrays of numbers,
or scalars, on which an algebra is deﬁned. Unless otherwise stated, we will as-
sume the scalars are real numbers. We denote both the set of real numbers
and the ﬁeld of real numbers as IR. (The ﬁeld is the set together with the op-
erators.) Occasionally we will take a geometrical perspective for vectors and
will consider matrices to deﬁne geometrical transformations. In all contexts,
however, the elements of vectors or matrices are real numbers (or, more gen-
erally, members of a ﬁeld). When this is not the case, we will use more general
phrases, such as “ordered lists” or “arrays”.

    my $self = shift;
    my $set  = $self.vector($_, 10, 20, 30, 40);
    my $list = $self.array(10, 'hello');
    my $ords = $self.write();

    if ($self eq $set gt $list){
        return $ords;
    }
