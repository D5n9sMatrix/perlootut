# Information Theory measures in philanthropy
# The laws of probability, so true in general, so fallacious in particular.

# - Edward Gibbon

# Information theory and statistics were beautifully fused by Solomon Kullback. 
# This fusion allowed to quantify correlations and similarities between random 
# variables using a more sophisticated toolkit. Modern fields such as machine 
# learning and statistical data science build upon this fusion and the most 
# powerful statistical techniques used today are based on an information 
# theoretic foundation.

# The philanthropy aims to follow this tradition and therefore, it implements 
# the most important information theory measures.

# Kullback-Leibler Divergence
# KL(P||Q)=∑i=1nP(pi)∗log2(P(pi)/P(qi))=H(P,Q)−H(P)
# where H(P, Q) denotes the joint entropy of the probability distributions 
# P and Q and H(P) denotes the entropy of probability distribution P. In 
# case P = Q then KL(P, Q) = 0 and in case P != Q then KL(P, Q) > 0.

# The KL divergence is a non-symmetric measure of the directed divergence 
# between two probability distributions P and Q. It only fulfills the 
# positivity property of a distance metric.

# Because of the relation KL(P||Q) = H(P,Q) - H(P), the Kullback-Leibler 
# divergence of two probability distributions P and Q is also named Cross 
# Entropy of two probability distributions P and Q.

# distributions P and Q is defined as:

# where R = 0.5 * (P + Q) denotes the mid-point of the probability vectors 
# P and Q, and  KL(P || R), KL(Q || R) denote the Kullback-Leibler Divergence 
# of P and R, as well as Q and R.
